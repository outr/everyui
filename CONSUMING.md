# Using EveryUI from another build

EveryUI is published locally for now: run `sbt publishLocal` in this repository, and the artifacts go to
`~/.ivy2/local/com.outr/`.

## Coordinates

| Module | What it is | Platforms |
|---|---|---|
| `"com.outr" %% "everyui-web" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"` | the UI layer (components, layouts, focus, keymaps, screens, theme, i18n) over the DOM | Scala.js |
| `"com.outr" %% "everyui-network" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"` | HTTP and DurableSocket, with Spice as the core | JVM and Scala.js |
| `"com.outr" %% "everyui-seo" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"` | what an app's server writes for search and answer engines | JVM |

Everything is built with Scala **3.10.0-RC3** and Scala.js **1.22.0**, so a consumer needs Scala 3.10 (an RC or
later) to read it.

A backend is chosen when EveryUI is compiled: the shared layer names `everyui.render.RenderNode`, and each backend
supplies it. So there is no separate core artifact. The shared layer ships inside each backend module, and
`everyui-web` is the web one. The desktop, Android, Roku and tvOS backends are still compiled from source (see NaboTV's
`build.sbt`).

## sbt

`project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scala-js" % "sbt-scalajs" % "1.22.0")
```

`build.sbt` (sbt 2 picks the `_sjs1` artifact for a Scala.js project from `%%`):

```scala
lazy val app = project.in(file("app"))
  .enablePlugins(ScalaJSPlugin)
  .settings(
    scalaVersion := "3.10.0-RC3",
    scalaJSUseMainModuleInitializer := true,
    Compile / mainClass := Some("myapp.main"),
    scalaJSLinkerConfig ~= (_.withModuleKind(ModuleKind.NoModule)
      .withESFeatures(_.withESVersion(org.scalajs.linker.interface.ESVersion.ES2021))),
    // Spice's Scala.js artifacts name some dependencies by their JVM names; keep the JVM reactify off the page
    excludeDependencies += ExclusionRule("com.outr", "reactify_3"),
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "com.outr" %% "everyui-web" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT",
      "com.outr" %% "everyui-network" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"   // only if the app talks to a server
    )
  )
```

## A minimal web app

```scala
package myapp

import everyui.app.screen.{ScreenManager, UIScreen}
import everyui.async.Task
import everyui.component.{Component, TextView}
import everyui.keymap.{Chord, Keymap}
import everyui.net.URLPath
import everyui.theme.Theme
import reactify.*

object Hello extends UIScreen {
  override def manager: ScreenManager = App
  override def path: URLPath = URLPath("/")

  private val count: Var[Int] = Var(0)
  private lazy val greeting = new TextView {
    content := "Hello, EveryUI (" + count().toString + ")"
    font.size @= 32.0
    color := Theme.text()
    focusable @= true
  }

  // this screen's own shortcut, in force while it shows
  keymap.add("hello.count", "Count", Chord("K", primary = true)) { count @= count() + 1 }

  override def defaultFocus(): Component = greeting
  override def createUI(): Task[Unit] = Task(container.children += greeting)
}

object App extends ScreenManager

@main def main(): Unit = {
  Keymap.global.add("hello.reset", "Reset", Chord.parse("Primary+Shift+R")) {
    everyui.kit.Toast.show("Reset")
  }
  App.run(Hello)
}
```

Check `UIScreen` for the members a screen overrides. The example app in `app/src/main/scala` shows more.

## The page

The bundle expects an element with the id `app` (it makes one if there is none) and the bundled faces in `fonts/`
next to the page. Copy `assets/fonts/*.ttf` from this repository, and add `assets/images` if the app uses them. A
minimal `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <style>
    @font-face { font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-weight: 400; src: url(fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf) format('truetype'); }
    @font-face { font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-weight: 600; src: url(fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf) format('truetype'); }
    @font-face { font-family: 'Material Icons'; font-weight: 400; src: url(fonts/MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf) format('truetype'); }
    @font-face { font-family: 'Roboto Mono'; font-weight: 400; src: url(fonts/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf) format('truetype'); }
    html, body { margin: 0; height: 100%; overflow: hidden; }
    #app { width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: hidden; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Link with `fastLinkJS` or `fullLinkJS`, and serve `main.js` next to the page. DataWrangler's `ui/webBundle` task
(its `build.sbt`) does this, with a content hash on the script's URL.

## Keys

Every key goes through `everyui.focus.Focus`. A `KeyEvent` carries `ctrl`, `meta`, `alt` and `shift`. Remotes (Roku,
tvOS) report none.

Shortcuts are commands in a keymap. `Keymap.global` is always in force. Each screen has its own `keymap`, which is in
force only while that screen shows and is asked first. A chord that runs a command is taken before the focused
component and the focus layer, and is kept from the browser (`preventDefault`).

```scala
Keymap.global.add("tab.close", "Close tab", Chord("W", primary = true)) { closeTab() }  // Ctrl+W, Cmd+W on a Mac
keymap.add("file.new", "New file", Chord.parse("Primary+Shift+N")) { newFile() }       // in a screen
Keymap.global.rebind("tab.close", Chord("F4", ctrl = true))
Keymap.global("tab.close").foreach(_.enabled := tabs().nonEmpty)
Keymap.listed   // every command in force, with its label and chords, for a shortcut list
```

Tab and Shift+Tab move the focus through the screen in tree order.

The browser never hands some chords to a page: Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+N in a normal tab. They work when
the app runs as an installed app window. Choose defaults with that in mind.

### Embeds

An embed is something in the page that handles its own keys, such as a code editor. It is marked
`data-everyui-embed="<name>"` on the web, or with the node property `Host.embedKey` on the desktop. A field that the
app did not make counts as the embed `"field"`. While the page's focus is inside an embed, every key is the embed's,
Escape included. EveryUI does not move the focus and does not `preventDefault`. Only two kinds of command still run:

```scala
Keymap.global("file.new").foreach(_.inEmbeds @= true)       // wins inside every embed
Keymap.embed("editor", Chord("W", primary = true))           // the chords this embed leaves to the app
```

An embed gives back a key it did not want. For example, an editor's Escape with no popup to close becomes Back:
`Focus.handBack("Escape")`.

## General components

Beyond the core components (`Button`, `Dialog`, `Table`, `ScrollContainer`, and so on), `everyui.kit` has these:

- `TabBar` and `TabItem`: a strip of tabs, fixed (`TabBar(List(key -> label), current, width)`) or open-ended
  (`add`, `remove`, closable tabs, the `closing` channel), with `icon` and `marker` slots beside each label.
- `Toast.show(words, seconds, top, margin)`: one short message at a time.
- `AsyncPress`: a press that runs slow work, with a delayed spinner, and failures toasted.
- `Spinner` and `Ring`: an indeterminate spinner and a determinate dial.
- `LazyRows`: a long list made as it is scrolled toward.
- `Turns`: work split over frames.
- `TextView.line`: one line that closes up when it is empty.
- `TextScroll`: text scrolled with the arrows.
- `ImageViewer`: pictures shown full screen, one at a time.
- `Mirror`: parts placed by hand, mirrored for right-to-left languages.
- `TextOutline.overPicture` and `TextOutline.overPictureLight`: edges for text over pictures.

## App chrome

Pieces most apps need around their content, each in a package of its own. They work with a pointer, a keyboard and a
remote alike, and take their words from the app (or from `everyui.i18n.Words` for OK, Cancel and the like).

### SplitPane (`everyui.split`)

Two parts side by side, or one over the other with `vertical = true`, and a handle between them that a pointer drags.
`ratio` is the first side's share (0 to 1): pass a Var the app keeps and saves. Each side keeps to its minimum
(`minFirst`, `minSecond`) while there is room for both. The `collapsible` side folds away on a double-click on the
handle, when dragged most of the way past its minimum, or by `toggle()`, and comes back at its ratio. The arrows cross
from one side to the other, and a split can be a side of another.

```scala
import everyui.split.{SplitPane, SplitSide}

val sidebar = Var(Platform.setting("sidebar").toDoubleOption.getOrElse(0.25))
sidebar.attach(r => Platform.saveSetting("sidebar", r.toString))
val split = new SplitPane(tree, new SplitPane(editor, console, vertical = true, ratio = Var(0.7)),
  ratio = sidebar, collapsible = Some(SplitSide.First))
split.size.width := ui.size.width()
split.size.height := ui.size.height()

Keymap.global.add("sidebar.toggle", "Toggle sidebar", Chord("B", primary = true)) { split.toggle() }
Keymap.global.add("sidebar.grow", "Wider sidebar", Chord.parse("Primary+Alt+ArrowRight")) { split.grow() }
Keymap.global.add("sidebar.shrink", "Narrower sidebar", Chord.parse("Primary+Alt+ArrowLeft")) { split.shrink() }
```

`split.handle.focusable @= true` puts the handle in the focus order too: the arrows along it move it, Enter folds.
The first side is always the left (or top) one, in a right-to-left language too.

### Menu (`everyui.menu`)

A list of choices: a context menu at the pointer (`Menu.at`), a menu dropped from a button (`Menu.below`), or a panel
in the middle of the screen under a title (`Menu.show`, what a remote wants). A `MenuItem` has a label, an action, an
optional icon, a line of detail, a shortcut hint (a keymap `Chord`) or a note, and may be disabled, dangerous,
checkable or a submenu; `MenuItem.separator` is a rule. Up and Down move round the entries that can be chosen, OK or a
click chooses (every menu closes, then the action runs), Right opens a submenu and Left, Back or Escape closes it, and
the pointer resting on an entry focuses it. The focus goes back where it was. `Menu.context` wires a component's
secondary click (`event.pointer.menu`, the new `PointerKind.Menu`), the menu key and OK held on a remote.

```scala
import everyui.menu.{Menu, MenuItem}

Menu.context(fileRow) {
  List(
    MenuItem("Open", () => open(file)),
    MenuItem.command(Keymap.global("file.rename").get),      // its label and its chord as the hint
    MenuItem.separator,
    MenuItem.sub("Copy", List(MenuItem("Path", () => copy(file.path)), MenuItem("Name", () => copy(file.name)))),
    MenuItem.check("Pinned", file.pinned, on => pin(file, on)),
    MenuItem("Delete", () => delete(file), MaterialIcon.Delete, danger = true))
}
moreButton.event.click.attach(_ => Menu.below(moreButton, items))
Menu.show(items, "Sort by")          // a television's menu
Menu.textSize @= 18.0                // set once, larger on a television
```

`Modal.show` and `Modal.over` take `dim = false` (leave what is under the dialog as it is) and `centre = false` (the
caller places the panel), which is how menus sit where they were opened.
